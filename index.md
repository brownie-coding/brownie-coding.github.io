## First Badge Coding Challenge with Scratch 
## Creating a Gem Chaser Game
1.  Go to the website - [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
1.  [Login](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=270s)
2.  [Click "Create"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=260s)
3.  [Name your program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=265s)
5.  [Pick a Backdrop and 3 Sprites (Sprite1, Crystal and Parrot)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=276s)
6.  [Adding Code to Sprite1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=388s)
    *   [Don't Forget to click on the Correct Sprite - start with Sprite1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=387s)
    *   [Adding Event Blocks to Sprite1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=432s)
       *   Start with the Event Block - "when ___ key pressed"
       *   One event for each arrow key up, right, left and down
    *   [Adding Motion Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=540s)
       *   Change the direction of the sprite to point in the direction of the movement finding the ["point in direction __ "](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=592s) under movement 
       *   Add the movement block to each event - 4 total, (adjust the direction to face direction for the keyblock 10:15)
       *   Move Steps block (10:36) (keep number of steps at 10)
       *   Check that the 4 events (yellow blocks) have 2 motion blocks (blue) under each them 
       *   That the arrow key matches the direction (11:00)
       * Noticing that Sprite1 moves off the end of the screen (13:47)
       * Fixing Sprite 1 by adding a If on Edge, bounce (14:08)
       *
