# Challenge Coding for Good with Scratch 
## Creating a Gem Chaser Game
Use your coding skills to create a game with 3 elements a cat, parrot and crystal. 

The cat will be controlled by the arrow buttons and the player will try to move the cat around the screen to avoid the bird while trying to catch the crystal. The cat will meow when it catches the crystal.

The bird will chase the cat, and make a noise when it catches the cat.

The crystal will move randomly around the board.

## Setup
1.  Go to the scratch website - [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
1.  If you would like to Login ask an adult to help you set up an account, or you can just use the browser version you can save it to the computer without creating an account. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=270s)
2.  Then click "Create" [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=260s)
![Click Create](/CreateButton.png)
4.  Name your program if you signed in. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=265s)
5.  Pick a Backdrop [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=276s)
     * Any backdrop will work, pick your favorite

6.  Pick the 3 Sprites 
     
     * Sprite1 (the cat is already picked for you)
     * Add Crystal, and Parrot
     <img src="/ChooseASprite.png" width="300">
    
     After clicking on "Choose A Sprite" start typing in the search box to find both Parrot and Crystal.

##  Adding Code to Sprite1 [Video Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=388s)
 1. Adding Event Blocks (Yellow) to Sprite1 [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=432s)
       *  Click on the Correct Sprite - start with Sprite1 (the cat) [Video Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=387s)
       *  Add the Event Block - "when ___ key pressed"
       *  Change the key so each Event responds to a different key
       *    <img src="/SpriteEventBlocksPickkey.png" width="300">
       *  One event for each arrow key up, right, left and down
       *    <img src="/Sprite1_eventblocks.png" width="300">
  2. Adding Motion Blocks (Blue) [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=540s)
    
    
     A.   Change the direction the sprite points by adding the Motion Block "point in direction __ " [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=592s) 
       *   Add the movement block to each event - 4 total, 
       *   Adjust the direction to face direction of movement [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=615s)
     
     B.    Take Steps by adding "Move __ Steps" block [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=636s)
       *   Check that the 4 events (yellow blocks) have 2 motion blocks (blue) under each them 
       *   <img src="/Sprite1_steps%20and%20direction.png" width="400">
       *   That the arrow key matches the direction of the steps [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=660s)
       
### Test your code       
   * Do you noticing that Sprite1 moves off the end of the screen [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=827s)
       * Keep Sprite1 in the frame by adding the Motion Block "If on edge, bounce" [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zEevGKPWs&t=848s)
       <img src="/Sprite1_bounce%20on%20edge.png" width="400">
   * Do you want Sprite1 to look like it's walking or running?
       * Add the Looks Block "next costume".
   * Do you want Sprite1 to move faster or slower?
       * Change the number in the "Move __ Steps" block.  
   * Do you want Sprite1 to move faster or slower?
       * Change the size in the setup area. 
## Adding Code to Crystal     
Now that the Cat can walk around we'd like the crystal to move around the board.

We would like this event to start as soon as we click the green flag. Drag the Events Block "when green flag clicked" to the design space.
